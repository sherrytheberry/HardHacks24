# HardHacks24
Hello! This is our project for hard hacks 2024 hosted by IEEE, HKN, and TNT!  
Our project was for the advanced path with a theme "A good time never ends" where we made an at home DJ deck with features such as present tunes, theremin, and lights that change based on sound intensity, done entirely through arduino sensors and conponets such as ultrasonics, buttons, buzzers, speakers and sound sensors.
